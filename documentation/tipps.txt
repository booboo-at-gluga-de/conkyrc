How to install Conky version 1.10 on Debian Jessie
--------------------------------------------------

Conky 1.10 offers more features and a new configuration syntax.
Debian Jessie by default delivers Conky 1.9
But there are backports available. To install them in a root shell:

    echo 'deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    aptitude update
    aptitude -t jessie-backports install conky-all
